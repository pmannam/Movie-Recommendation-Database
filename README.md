# Movie Database Project

This project focuses on designing and implementing a movie database with specific attributes and functionalities. The database includes seven main tables: users, movies, taginfo, genres, ratings, tags, and hasagenre.

## Background

In this database, a movie is defined by two attributes: `id` and `title`. For example, a movie record appears as follows: `54796, 2 Days in Paris (2007)`.

Movies can be categorized into multiple genres, selected from a predefined set including Action, Adventure, Animation, Childrenâ€™s, Comedy, Crime, etc. A movie may belong to one or more genres or none at all.

Users can provide ratings on a 5-star scale (0-5) for a movie. Each user can rate a movie once, and the database logs each rating operation. The database enforces not allowing out-of-range ratings.

Additionally, users can assign tags to movies. A tag is a single word or short phrase, and a user can tag a movie multiple times. The meaning, value, and purpose of a tag are determined by each user. The database logs each tagging operation.
